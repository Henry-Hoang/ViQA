{"id": "100008", "contents": "Sputtering cathode sputtering is a technique for fabricating thin films based on the principle of kinetic energy transfer by using rare-gas ions accelerated under an electric field from the material's target, which transfers the kinetic energy to the atoms that fly toward the base and deposit on the base. The nature of sputtering is sputtering. Unlike thermal transport, sputtering does not cause the material to evaporate due to heating, but rather is kinetic energy transfer. The source material is formed as target plates and placed at an electrode (usually a cathode) in a chamber that is high vacuumed and filled with rare-gas at a low pressure (at 10 mbar ). Under the action of an electric field, the rare-gas atoms are ionized, accelerated and moved toward the target at a high rate and bombarded the target surface, which transfers the kinetic energy to the material's atoms at the target surface. The transferred energy atoms fly toward the base and deposit on the base. These atoms are called sputtered atoms. Thus, the mechanism of sputtering is collision and exchange of momentum, which is completely different from the mechanism of vacuum thermal transport. The glow discharge sputtering technique DC discharge sputtering is a sputtering technique that uses a one-way voltage to accelerate rare-gas ions. The target is placed on a cathode in a vacuum bell that is high vacuumed and then filled with rare-gas (usually argon) at a low pressure (at 10 mbar ). A high one-way voltage is used between the target (negative electrode) and the sample base (positive electrode ). This process is a glow discharge accompanied by ionization. Since the current is a one-way current, the electrodes must be conductive to maintain the current, so this technique is usually only used for conductive targets (metal, alloy, etc. ). Rotational discharge sputtering Sputtering magnetron sputtering is a sputtering technique (used both alternately and unidirectionally) that is improved from common sputtering systems by placing underneath the target magnets. The magnetic field of the magnet traps electrons in the vicinity of the target, thereby increasing the ionization effect by increasing the frequency of the electrons' collision with gas atoms near the target surface, thereby accelerating the deposition rate while reducing the bombardment of electrons and ions on the film surface,"}

One of the major processes of protein synthesis, the function of which is the synthesis of proteins directly. Some molecules of RNA carry amino acids to the ribosome complex, where the ribosomal molecules are coupled to form the pre-protein chain. In general, a base attached to the 3' position of a ribose and to the 5' position of the ribose are the 2'-hydroxyl group, which causes the RNA to fold and pair with itself to form a double strand. Analysis of these RNAs shows that they have a high-level structure. Unlike DNA, RNA contains a double strand that is too long, but is a system consisting of short double strand that is attached to proteins.

Lottery has many forms. For example, the prize can be a fixed percentage of the total ticket amount (commonly 50% of the ticket amount ). Many recent lotteries allow buyers to choose the numbers on the lottery ticket, leading to the possibility of many winners in a lottery. Lottery in Vietnam. In Vietnam, there are two types of lottery: conventional lottery, which are separated by provincial scale, and electronic lottery (such as Vietlott ). The Ministry of Finance manages provincial lottery companies, which conduct lottery spinning and pay prizes to winners.

In Hanoi, the lottery agent system has grown attached to ordinary lottery stores and iced tea shops, which are quite public. In addition, some players have switched to gambling on the Internet. According to lottery companies, lottery revenues are decreasing because they are unable to compete with Vietlott and lotteries.

The castle was located on the Motobu Peninsula, on a rocky outcrop overlooking the East China Sea. The castle was separated from the main blocks on the Motobu Peninsula to the east by a deep slope forming a canyon with a stream below. A deep slope from the north and northeast of the castle sloped straight down to the coast. A small harbor in the bay used to be located just there to serve the castle, while Unten Harbor, the North Shan kingdom's main port, was located about 5-6 miles east. The royal palace was located at the highest and inner parts of the castle and surrounded by a small garden and a stream. Three temples (uganju, temples) were located on the top of the steep wall. In a fence that was outside rather than in the palace, at a slightly lower elevation, were the houses of vassals, along with administrative buildings. As a typical of the gusuku construction and at the time, the castle had a very strong, but rather rough, stone wall, lacking an exact assembly. About 1,500 meters of limestone wall remains today.

During this period, people living in low-lying areas along the coast moved to higher areas and built inland villages. Plants such as rice, wheat, and millet were further developed during this period. Sacred forests called utaki were created in these villages to form sacred sites to pray to souls to protect the fields. International trade also emerged as the Ryukyu Islands began to form a common culture. The existence of Sueki porcelain and Chinese ceramics excavated in the islands is considered strong evidence of its cultural development. In the thirteenth century, there emerged the Aji or Anji rulers who held power in the villages. The work of the Aji chiefly oversaw taxation and religious ceremonies. Trade grew and allowed the Aji to increasingly occupy cargo ports in Urasoe, Yomitan, Nakagusuku, Katsuren, Sashiki, and Nakijin. The three Shaman kingdoms were formed as the Aji rulers struggled to defend their domains. Ryukyu was divided into three kingdoms, the northern and central Nakijin Gusuku, the central Urasoe Gusuku, and the southernmost Nanzan, centered on Shimajiri Ozato.

The scientist Ernst Zermelo discovered the same thing, but he did not publish his discovery, only revealed it to Edmund Husserl and some other members of the University of Gttingen. According to the simple set theory, any definable group of things is treated as a set. Here, suppose R is a set of all sets that are not members of itself. If R exists as a set of itself, R contradicts the definition of a set of all sets that are not members of itself. On the contrary, if a set such as R is not a member of itself, then by definition it will exist as a member of itself. The content of this passage is the Russell paradox. Written in symbols, the paradox is this: There are two alternatives to solving this paradox proposed in 1908. One of them is Russell's type theory, and the second is Zermelo's set theory, the first version of axiomatic set theory. Zermelo's axioms went well beyond Frege's axioms of extensionality and unlimited set abstraction, and eventually evolved into Zermelo \u2013 Fraenkel set theory (ZF ).

Symptoms may include abdominal pain, constipation, headache, irritability, memory disturbances, inability to have children, and tingling of the hands and feet. It causes nearly 10% of intellectual disability of otherwise unknown cause and may cause behavioral problems. Some effects are permanent. In severe cases, anemia, epilepsy, coma, or death may occur. Exposure to lead may occur due to contaminated air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Children are at higher risk because they are more likely to place objects in their mouths such as lead containers and absorb a greater proportion of the lead they ingest. Workplace exposures are a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations that pose a particular risk. Diagnosis is typically by measuring lead levels in the blood. The Centers for Disease Control (US) have established an upper limit for blood lead in adults at 10 g / dl (10 g / 100 g) and for children at 5 g/dl. Increased lead levels can also be detected by changes in red blood cells or solid lines in the bones of children as seen on X-rays. Lead poisoning is preventable. This includes individual efforts such as removing lead containers from homes, workplace efforts such as improved ventilation and monitoring, and national policies such as laws banning products such as paints and gasoline, in water or soil, and providing for cleanup of contaminated soil. The main treatments are removal of the lead source and use of drugs that bind lead so that it can be removed from the body, known as chelation therapy. Chelation therapy in children is recommended when blood levels are greater than 40 \u2013 45 g/dl. The drugs used include dimercaprol, calcium edetate sodium, and succimer.

Many tourists and native inhabitants pray before the lithuanian gates. The lithuanian gates were first built in 1519, during the reign of Sh Shin, but the space had been regarded as utaki before. Whenever the king left the city for a journey, he stopped at Sonohyan-utaki to pray for a smooth trip. The ruins also play an important role in the native religion. The lithuanian gates are considered a good example of traditional Okinawan architecture, and show many expressions of Chinese influence, in addition to a Japanese-influenced karahafu. The lithuanian gates were badly damaged in the Battle of Okinawa in 1957, but were restored in 1957, and officially became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000, along with several other monuments on Okinawa Island. The Utaki, the sacred forests themselves, were once much larger than they are today, and a school of them and other buildings invaded the forest's space."}
